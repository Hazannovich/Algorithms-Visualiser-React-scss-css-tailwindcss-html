        <p>
          Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a
          target value within a sorted array.
          <br></br> Binary search compares the target value to the middle
          element of the array.
          <br></br> If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot
          lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half,
          again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and
          repeating this until the target value is found.
